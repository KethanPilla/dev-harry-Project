I need it to be a food delivery app.
it should have 3 categories in the menu 
1. Make your own Burger.
and when I select the burger I should be asked what kind of bun(give 3 options with radio buttons).
next option is select the meat(chicken patty, beef patty, pork patty, veg patty. use radio button to select).
use check boxes to select the pickle, chille sauce, mustard sauce, special sauce, buffalo sauce, mayo.
option to double stack the burger.
Now have an option to add this to the cart with pricing ($1 for each option selected).
In the cart we should have the option to add more. Clicking on the option will redirect us to the menu.
2. Make your own Pizza.
If I select the pizza,My options would be.
Base choice: Hand tossed, fresh pan, cheese crust. use radio buttons.
toppings: bannana peppers

3. Make your own pasta.
